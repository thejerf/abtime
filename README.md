    go get github.com/thejerf/abtime

A library for abstracting away from the literal Go time library and the
context's cancellation and timeout libraries, for testing and time control.

In any code that seriously uses time, such as billing or scheduling code,
best software engineering practices are that you should not directly
access the operating system time. This module provides you with code to
implement that principle in Go.

See some discussions:

This module is fully covered with
[godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/thejerf/abtime), including examples,
usage, and everything else you might expect from a README.md on GitHub.
(DRY.)

# Why abtime and not the more popular clock abstractions?

Most if not all other time testing abstractions for Go attempt to simulate
the passage of time itself. That is, you can set a Timer for a second from
now, then, you tell the time replacement module that one second has passed,
and it will trigger the timer at that point.

That is indeed simpler for simple use cases than what I have here, and
permits a drop-in interface replacement for the whole module. However,
it does not permit you to test _all_ scenarios, because it is built on
a fundamentally false premise, which is that time is a monotonic,
agreed-upon value for all goroutines. That is not how goroutines "perceive"
time.

In reality, if you give one goroutine a timer for 1 second in the future,
and another goroutine a timer for 1.1 seconds in the future, it is entirely
possible for the second goroutine to entirely finish its execution before
the first one even gets woken up. (The first goroutine may well have had
its timer triggered, but then immediately descheduled for whatever reason,
while the second runs to completion.)

Proper testing of complex time-dependent multi-goroutine coordination
requires deeper levels of control than a compatible API can offer. This
package takes the hit of having to add unique IDs to timers and tickers
in order to permit a deeper level of testing, as proper testing of
time-sensitive code must be able to consider the case where events in
different goroutines happen "out of order", because they will.

If you only have one goroutine using time-based code then this package may
be overkill. However, if you have multiple goroutines interacting with each
other while also referring to the clock, you may find this package is
worthwhile as it will permit you to set up important test scenarios that
drop-in replacements for the time package simply can not express.

# Changelog

* 1.0.7:
  * Fixups in the internal registration of triggerable events.
  * Added wrappers around context.WithTimeout and context.WithCancel that
    allow controlled cancellation of contexts like the rest of time-based
    code.
* 1.0.6:
  * Manual timer needs to reflect whether it was stopped, not _that_ it was
    stopped.
  * This also cleans up some of the concurrency. This was one of my earlier
    libraries. The place where a goroutine is spawned to perform the
    various triggered actions should now be more correct.
* 1.0.5:
  * (INCORRECT) The manual timer is ALWAYS successfully stopped by a Stop
    call, so .Stop must always return true.
* 1.0.4:
  * Add ticker.Reset for Go 1.15. This version requires Go 1.15.
  * Add proper go module support.
* 1.0.3:
  * Fix locking for Unregister and UnregisterAll.
* 1.0.2
  * Adds support for unregistering triggers, so the ids can be reused with
    the same abtime object.

    As the godoc says, this is a sign of some sort of flaw, but it is not
    yet clear how to handle it. I still haven't found a good option for an
    API for this stuff. My original goal with abtime was to be as close to
    the original `time` API as possible, I'm considering abandoning
    that. Though I still don't know what exactly that would look like.

    (Plus, this need some sort of context support now.)
* 1.0.1
  * [Issue 3](https://github.com/thejerf/abtime/issues/3) reports a
    reversal in the sense of the timer.Reset return value, which is
    fixed. While fixing this, a race condition in setting the underlying
    value was also fixed.
* 1.0.0
  * Initial Release.

# On the Abtime API

Perusing the abtime API will quickly reveal that unlike other clock-mocking
libraries in Go, the abtime API introduces additional `ID` parameters to
the calls you make, which are ignored when using real time.

This is because as nice as the API may be, it is a mistake for a
clock-mocking library to bake in the assumption that your code can
assume the existence of a monotonic time, because in multi-threaded code,
you can not count on that. Just because you have alarm A firing in
1000ms in one thread and alarm B firing in a different thread in 1001ms,
that does not mean that you can assume A will fire before B. That's an
error in multithreading code, and in my opinion, any mocking library needs
to be able to help you test that even if B fires first, everything will
still work as desired. Writing into the API that the only way to trigger
alarms and such is by monotonically advancing the clock precludes this
possibility from the beginning, however convenient it may be.

Abtime uses additional parameters to get around that.

You can still get into situations where testing is difficult or
inconventient. However I have not been able to work out an API that is any
better or safer, or I'd make a 2.0. Generally what's been provided by this
library has been enough.

In my personal experince, the only thing I use the clock advancing for
is test stability for code that needs to add time stamps for things.
When testing triggers and alarms, it's often perfectly sufficient to
just trigger them and not advance the clock at all. It's generally the
logic you're testing, and the various paths code can execute through, not
actual time handling itself. So in practice I don't generally miss having
the nice "just advance the clock" API as much as you would think.

# Stability

As I have been using this code for a while now and it has stopped changing,
this is now at version 1.0.0.

# Commit Signing

Starting with the commit after 3003eee879c, I will be signing this repository
with the ["jerf" keybase account](https://keybase.io/jerf). If you are viewing
this repository through GitHub, you should see the commits as showing as
"verified" in the commit view.

(Bear in mind that due to the nature of how git commit signing works, there
may be runs of unverified commits; what matters is that the top one is
signed.)
